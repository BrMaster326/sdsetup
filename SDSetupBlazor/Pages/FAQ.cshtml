		Why can ZIPs take so long to generate?
	</div>
	<div class="content @(active[1] == true ? "active" : "")">
		<p>This application uses the experimental Blazor project by the ASP.NET team. This software, while functional, has many performance issues. Other than C# code often running up to 100x slower than a native desktop app, native C# zip libraries run way too slow to be useful. As such, all files need to be downloaded individually and fed into a JavaScript zip library, which takes much longer than downloading compressed zip files. Additionally, at this moment in time, Blazor code can only run on one thread.</p>

		Why Blazor?
	</div>
	<div class="content @(active[5] == true ? "active" : "")">
		<p>Most of my programming experience is in C# and Java, as such, I prefered to stick to what I know when making this (though I knew some JS interop would be necessary regardless). Plus I get to try out some cool new stuff!</p>

		You know Blazor is experimental and isn't meant for production, right?
	</div>
	<div class="content @(active[6] == true ? "active" : "")">
		<p>Since this app is entirely client-side (static), there is no security involved anywhere outside of basic HTTPS (99% of which is done in JS anyways), and compatibility is fine with Chrome and Firefox, I didn't see any reason not to use Blazor.</p>
